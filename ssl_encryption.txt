In production all the calls should be running with ssl encryption enabled.
This is done by generating SSL certificates.
SSL allows the communication to be secure end to end ensuing no Man in the middle attack
can be performed.

How SSL works?


Why do we need encryption?
When you communicate over the internet , your data is visible by all the servers
that transfer your packet.
It means any router on the internet can access the password which is bad and hence
we do not login to the website using http.

SSL allows client and server to encrypt packets.

gRPC server and client decrypts 
Router cannot view the contents of internet packets


TLS (Transport layer security), successor of SSL, encrypts the connection between 
two endpoints for secure exchange of data.
